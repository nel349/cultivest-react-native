#### Key Entities:

1.  **`User`**: Represents an individual user of the Cultivest platform.
    *   **Attributes**: `userID` (Primary Key), `phoneNumber`, `name`, `country`, `email`, `currentBalanceUSDCa`, `currentBalanceALGO`, `dailyYieldAccumulated`, `moneyTreeLeaves`, `kycStatus`, `supabaseAuthID` (linking to Supabase's authentication user).

2.  **`Wallet`**: Represents the custodial Algorand wallet managed by Cultivest on behalf of the user. This is where user funds (USDCa and ALGO) are held.
    *   **Attributes**: `walletID` (Primary Key), `userID` (Foreign Key to `User`), `algorandAddress` (the public address), `encryptedPrivateKey` (the **securely encrypted** private key for this custodial wallet), `assetID` (e.g., for USDCa).
