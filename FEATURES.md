## 2. Data Model Overview (ERD)

The core of Cultivest's data architecture will revolve around managing user accounts, their custodial wallets, and financial transactions.

#### Key Entities:

1.  **`User`**: Represents an individual user of the Cultivest platform.
    *   **Attributes**: `userID` (Primary Key), `phoneNumber`, `name`, `country`, `email`, `currentBalanceUSDCa`, `dailyYieldAccumulated`, `moneyTreeLeaves`, `kycStatus`, `supabaseAuthID` (linking to Supabase's authentication user).

2.  **`Wallet`**: Represents the custodial Algorand wallet managed by Cultivest on behalf of the user. This is where user funds (USDCa) are held.
    *   **Attributes**: `walletID` (Primary Key), `userID` (Foreign Key to `User`), `algorandAddress` (the public address), `encryptedPrivateKey` (the **securely encrypted** private key for this custodial wallet), `assetID` (e.g., for USDCa).

3.  **`Transaction`**: Records all financial movements within the platform related to a user's account.
    *   **Attributes**: `transactionID` (Primary Key), `userID` (Foreign Key to `User`), `walletID` (Foreign Key to `Wallet`), `type` (e.g., 'deposit', 'investment', 'withdrawal', 'yield_credit'), `amountUSDCa`, `fiatAmount`, `fiatCurrency`, `timestamp`, `status`, `algorandTxID`, `externalTxID` (for MoonPay/Flutterwave).

4.  **`InvestmentPosition`**: Tracks a user's current active investment in the Tinyman USDCa pool.
    *   **Attributes**: `positionID` (Primary Key), `userID` (Foreign Key to `User`), `poolID` (identifying the specific liquidity pool, e.g., Tinyman USDCa), `investedAmountUSDCa`, `startDate`, `currentAPY`, `totalYieldEarned`.

5.  **`Badge`**: Defines the gamified achievement badges.
    *   **Attributes**: `badgeID` (Primary Key), `name`, `description`, `criteria`.

6.  **`UserBadge`**: A junction table to record which badges a user has earned.
    *   **Attributes**: `userID` (Foreign Key to `User`), `badgeID` (Foreign Key to `Badge`), `awardedAt`.

7.  **`EducationalContent`**: Stores information about the educational videos and quizzes.
    *   **Attributes**: `contentID` (Primary Key), `type` ('video' or 'quiz'), `title`, `url` (for video), `quizQuestions` (e.g., JSON array), `unlocksBadgeID` (Foreign Key to `Badge`, if applicable).

8.  **`UserQuizResult`**: Records a user's performance on quizzes.
    *   **Attributes**: `resultID` (Primary Key), `userID` (Foreign Key to `User`), `contentID` (Foreign Key to `EducationalContent`), `score`, `completedAt`.

#### Key Relationships:

*   **One-to-Many (`1:M`)**:

    *   `EducationalContent` can have many `UserQuizResult`s.

*   **Many-to-Many (`M:M`)**:
    *   `User` and `Badge` have a Many-to-Many relationship, facilitated by the `UserBadge` junction table.

- [ ] "Funds growing" animation (mobile/web)
- [ ] Web support for investment flow (Expo Router)

**Implementation Notes**:  
- Algorand Web3.js integrates with Tinyman's audited USDCa pool for yield generation. Backend Node.js on Vercel will handle transaction signing and broadcasting for custodial wallets.
- Claude 4 API (mocked) suggests investment based on deposit amount.  
- Lottie animation shows coins flowing to vault.

- [ ] "First Investor!" badge for first deposit
- [ ] Push notifications for daily yield updates (mobile only)
- [ ] Web dashboard support (Expo Router, NativeWind)

**Implementation Notes**:  
- Built with React Native, NativeBase, and Lottie for "money tree" animation (grows with balance).  
- Firebase push notifications for mobile (e.g., "$0.003 earned today!"). (Note: if backend sends notifications, it will be via Vercel backend interacting with Firebase FCM).
- Web dashboard (`app/index.tsx`) reuses mobile components, optimized for Chrome with NativeWind CSS, hosted on Netlify.  
- MongoDB stores balance/yield data, updated via Tinyman API, managed by Vercel backend.

- [ ] Tooltips for stablecoin/yield terms
- [ ] Web support for video/quiz (Expo Router)

**Implementation Notes**:  
- Static HTML video hosted on Vercel, embedded in React Native/WebView.  
- Quiz uses NativeBase forms, stores results in Supabase (PostgreSQL) via Vercel backend.
- Tooltips via NativeBase Popover component, explaining terms (e.g., "USDCa: dollar-backed stablecoin").  
- Web reuses mobile video/quiz with CSS for browser compatibility, hosted on Netlify.

## 7. Withdrawal
- [ ] Withdraw $1‚Äì$10 to bank via MoonPay/Flutterwave (1% fee)

- [ ] Read-only operations for Tinyman queries

**Implementation Notes**:  
- Custodial wallet simplifies user experience; clear disclosure on data handling.  
- MoonPay KYC data not stored locally; Supabase handles auth securely, and sensitive wallet keys are encrypted and managed by the Vercel backend with a dedicated key management strategy.
- Tinyman API queries are read-only, logged via Chainalysis for AML compliance.  
- Web/mobile share privacy settings, displayed via NativeBase modal.

## 9. Mobile + Web Optimized UI
- [ ] Responsive design (mobile: iOS/Android; web: Chrome)
- [ ] Dark theme for readability
- [ ] Touch-friendly controls (mobile); click-friendly (web)
- [ ] Fast loading states with feedback animations

**Implementation Notes**:

- NativeBase supports dark theme, toggled via user settings.  
- Lottie animations provide loading feedback (e.g., spinning coins).  
- Web uses NativeWind CSS for responsive layouts, tested on low-end browsers for Nigeria, hosted on Netlify.

## 10. Performance Optimization
- [ ] Efficient Algorand/Tinyman API queries
- [ ] Local caching of recent deposits/yields
- [ ] Progressive loading for dashboard data

- Progressive loading for "money tree" data, reducing load time to <2s.  
- Supabase OTP supports offline verification, critical for Nigeria (50MB/month data).  
- Web caching mirrors mobile, using browser local storage.

## 11. Open-Source Infrastructure
- [ ] Well-documented codebase
- [ ] Contribution guidelines
- [ ] MIT license
- [ ] Deployment instructions for Vercel/Heroku

**Implementation Notes**:  
- Codebase documented with JSDoc, hosted on GitHub.  
- Contribution guidelines include setup and PR process.  
- MIT license ensures open-source accessibility.  
- Vercel (backend API) and Netlify (web frontend) deployment guides provided. Heroku is an alternative backend deployment option.

## 12. Security Roadmap (Post-Hackathon)

Given the custodial wallet approach, robust security for private key storage is paramount for a production environment. The Vercel-hosted backend will be responsible for implementing these measures.

**12.1. Key Storage & Management**
- [ ] Implement strong encryption (e.g., AES-256) for all private keys stored in the database.
- [ ] Ensure unique encryption keys per user/wallet, derived from a secure, salted KDF.
- [ ] Implement secure key management: master encryption keys will be stored separately from encrypted wallet data, ideally in a Hardware Security Module (HSM) or a Cloud Key Management Service (KMS) like AWS KMS, Google Cloud KMS, or Azure Key Vault, accessed securely by the Vercel backend.
- [ ] Restrict access to encryption keys and encrypted data with strict access controls and multi-factor authentication (MFA).
- [ ] Enforce least privilege principles for all system access.

**12.2. Operational Security**
- [ ] Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing by third-party experts.
- [ ] Implement robust logging and monitoring for all key access and transaction signing operations on the Vercel backend.
- [ ] Adopt a Hot/Warm/Cold wallet strategy to minimize online exposure of user funds.
    -   Hot Wallet: Minimal funds for immediate transactions.
    -   Warm Wallet: Moderate funds requiring multi-signature or time-locked access.
    -   Cold Wallet: Majority of user funds stored offline, requiring manual or highly secure multi-party approval for large withdrawals.
- [ ] Implement automated alerts for suspicious activity or unauthorized access attempts.
